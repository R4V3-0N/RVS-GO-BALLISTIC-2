<!--Final event: you arrive to the destination which is already over run with rebels and destroyed. You have to destroy the enemy Rebel cruiser within the alloted time to get a high reward and a weapon, if you took a bit too long you still have a bit of leeway, the Convoy got damaged but they are still mostly safe, if you took too long the convoy is destroeyd and it is safe to jump away.  Destroying the Cruiser should still give a high to medium reward regardles as salvage. Anything baring the convoys destruction should unlock the freihgter. After saving the convoy there will be a mention of them regrouping and heading to the last stand instead as their alternate destination for a special encounter I am still brainstorming.  The ship you saved from the start if you refueled them should also provide bomb support here. When the convoy is destroyed enemy ASB is activated 

<text> You were expecting to see a fully operational Forward Operating Base here and an attachment of ships. However, you are met with disaster as signs of a recent battle litter this system with all reactor signatures showing dead: Well, except a squadron of Rebel ships here eager to pounce on their prey! "Renegade! This is Supply Officer Kyrylo hailing. Mission aborted! The FOB is destroyed. I repeat the FOB is destroyed. There is nothing left here for us. We're exfiltrating immediately but something jamming our drives! You need to buy us some time".  With the escorts engaging the lighter enemy ships you take on the biggest ship here and draw its fire away from the convoy. You have to make this quick or the convoy will take significant damage!"  </text>
