The ethereal beauty of this unspoiled expanse is a fleeting treasure you know won't remain hidden for long.

As your vessel penetrates the shimmering veil, the brilliant particles come alive in a mesmerizing ballet. Mining drones hum to life, diligently extracting the valuable resources that have remained untouched until now. Each haul underscores the untouched grandeur of this system, yet as your ship departs, laden with riches, you can't shake the feeling that your actions have irreversibly shifted the balance of this pristine sanctuary.</text>

Your crew works tirelessly, manually extracting the valuable resources that have remained untouched until now. As your ship departs the ring, laden with riches, a sense of reverence mingles with the weight of responsibility. It's clear that your presence has initiated a transformation of this once-undisturbed haven.</text>

	<text>Emerging from your jump, you find yourself amidst a remarkable tableau. A lush planet stretches before you, transformed into a testament of unity. Alien races, once estranged, now work together, their ships repurposed into temporary shelters and structures within their budding settlements. Various alien races such as the Orchids, Rockmen, Aquarians, Slugs, and Humans have gathered here and call this land their home, a rare and heartening sight in a universe often marked by strife.&#10;&#10;You are left to wonder if it is a fleeting collaboration or perhaps it may hold the answers to a more peaceful universe. The latter may hold some merit, as the settlers have offered an invitation to land and join them for some freshly made pastries and a small helping of left over scrap materials from their ships' conversions.</text>

	<text>Upon your arrival you find the source of the distress signal, a drifting hulk that has since long been abandoned... You are left to your imagination as to what may have happened to their crew.</text>
	<text>Responding to the distress signal you spot what appears to be the source. Floating motionlessly your scans indicate that every airlock has been left open. Potentially the results of an electronic attack or a very unfortunate series of events following a fire. Once full of life the ship now drifts through the endless expanse.</text>
	<text>You receive a patchy transmission immediately on arrival "Mayday, Ma-**-ay, Mayday! We have run out of fuel and are awaiting immediate assistance!... We encountered a ******* ***** ****** *-nd **** ** ***... we're running low o-* rations and we do-** **** much ti-** left... **** starved out just over a week ago... Please if you can hear this please resp-***!" You rush to aid the survivors but to your dismay the ship shows on scans completely empty on closer inspection. You're listening to a pre-recorded message which only continues to get more and more laden with static until it abruptly stops as the ship's backup generator dies... you are left wondering what had happened here.</text>
	<text>Rushing to aid the distressed vessel, you assess its plight - their fuel reserves are empty and their reactor has gone cold leaving the ship to be left adrift for a long time now. Despite your best analysis you can not deduce the eventual fate of the crew or their current whereabouts.</text>

We used up the last of our FTL fuel to make a jump to this colony, aiming to find sanctuary in the midst of this uncharted frontier, but, well... it seems we misjudged the distance by a mere jump.

	<text>The ship emitting the distress beacon messages you, "Sorry to bother you, but we're out of fuel and can't get out of this uncharted sector. Could you help us out?</text>
	<text>A small civilian ship flies over as soon as you arrive. You're prepared to fight but they just inform you that they're out of FTL fuel and can't jump.</text>
	<text>Deep in the frontier, a survey vessel drifts, its engines dormant. A weak signal breaks the silence: "Tasked with mapping these stars, oh so many stars there are... stars stars stars..., we misjudged our fuel oh we did yes we did. Stranded far from the closest station or civilization!, our engines are silent. Can you assist?"</text>
