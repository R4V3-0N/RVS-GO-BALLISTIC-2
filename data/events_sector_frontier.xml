	<text>Emerging from your jump, you find yourself in the embrace of a pristine star system, still untouched by the tide of colonists that sweep through this sector. The ethereal beauty of this unspoiled expanse is a fleeting treasure you know won't remain hidden for long. Before you lies a mineral-rich ring, its untouched splendor encircling a majestic gas giant, a sight rarely seen in the reaches of space you traverse but one that tempts you to spoil it.</text>

			<text>Giving into the temptation, you navigate your ship into the mineral-rich ring encircling the gas giant. As your vessel penetrates the shimmering veil, the brilliant particles come alive in a mesmerizing ballet. Mining drones hum to life, diligently extracting the valuable resources that have remained untouched until now. Each haul underscores the untouched grandeur of this system, yet as your ship departs, laden with riches, you can't shake the feeling that your actions have irreversibly shifted the balance of this pristine sanctuary.</text>

			<text>Opting to momentarily set aside the allure of riches, you choose instead to focus on your ship's upkeep. Against the backdrop of the mineral-rich ring's beauty, you take a moment to appreciate the untouched serenity of the cosmos. The interplay of particles becomes a soothing reminder of the universe's majesty, offering a respite from the clamor of ambition as our FTL drive hums in the background as it charges.</text>

		<text>Amid the satisfaction of your successful harvest, fate takes an abrupt turn. The ship becomes ensnared within the ring's embrace, and asteroids awaken to pummel your ship. Your ship is unscathed just yet but urgency fills the air as your crew fights to charge their FTL drive to get out before the universe decides to punish us any further.</text>

The glittering particles come alive as your vessel passes through them, a breathtaking cosmic display. Your crew works tirelessly, manually extracting the valuable resources that have remained untouched until now. As your ship departs the ring, laden with riches, a sense of reverence mingles with the weight of responsibility. It's clear that your presence has initiated a transformation of this once-undisturbed haven.</text>

	<autoReward level="MED">standard</autoReward>
	<text>Emerging from your jump, you find yourself amidst a remarkable tableau. A lush planet stretches before you, transformed into a testament of unity. Alien races, once estranged, now work together, their ships repurposed into temporary shelters and structures within their budding settlements. Various alien races such as the Orchids, Rockmen, Aquarians, Slugs, and Humans have gathered here and call this land their home, a rare and heartening sight in a universe often marked by strife.&#10;&#10;You are left to wonder if it is a fleeting collaboration or perhaps it may hold the answers to a more peaceful universe. The latter may hold some merit, as the settlers have offered an invitation to land and join them for some freshly made pastries and a small helping of left over scrap materials from their ships' conversions.</text>

	<text back="BACKGROUND">A lone rock vessel is lost in the distant stars far from their colonies. Instead of turning to you for salvation, they've decided to take their frustration out on you.</text>
	<text back="BG_NEBULA">Sensors indicate a single Rock vessel holding in an attack stance broadcasting to you on open channels. "The Gods have blessed me with the beauty of this sector and I won't let you spread the Federations blight here. Perish!"</text>	
	<text planet="PLANET_UNPOPULATED">A rock ship has taken a journey through this sector on a pilgramage in search of their place in the universe. Your attempts to hail them interrupts their meditation. Taking offense at your act, they arm their weapons!</text>
	
	<!-- colonies-->
	<text planet="PLANET_LAVA">The Rockmen are hardy people: What may look like a completely uninhabitable planet below is actually in the process of having a colony established. However, a Rock patrol ship protecting the colony considers you a pirate and decides to ward you off with extreme prejudice.</text>
	<text>The Theocracy often takes no chances with outsiders and this is even more so evident out in the frontier. They arm their weapons and you follow in kind.</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_POPULATED_SMALL">"Outsider! These lands are claimed by the Theocracy! You have insulted us with your presence, prepare to die!" A fight is unavoidable.</text>

	<!-- normal -->
	<text>You encounter a Rock vessel and attempt to open trading frequencies, but they take it as an act of cultural transgression and open fire.</text>
	<text>It looks quiet, but you realize your computer is being scanned. A hidden Rock vessel hails you: "Why do you fill your computer with lies?! These are not the holy words!" Before you can interject they open fire.</text>
	<text>You notice a Rock ship performing combat exercises. However, they quickly change their course to engage your ship. They apparently treat unregistered alien ships as handy target practice.</text>

	<text planet="NONE">It comes to no surprise to find an automated forward scout of the Rebel fleet so far out lurking amongst the stars. A fight is unavoidable.</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_UNPOPULATED">You have arrived at an uninhabited system with no signs of colonization, except for a Rebel Autonomous scout exploring this beacon and they do not seem willing to share their discoveries with you.</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_UNPOPULATED">Sensor readings reveal the remains of an ill-fated Union Carryship, once brimming with hopeful colonists, now a lifeless derelict adrift in this beacon's vicinity. As you cautiously draw nearer to investigate, a Rebel Automated ship abruptly emerges from the wreckage, swiftly transitioning from its hiding place to a predatory stance, ready to seize its next victim.</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_UNPOPULATED_TERRA">One of the Rebels unmanned scout ships has been spotted patrolling around the frontier. Its AI considers you a significant threat! A fight is unavoidable.</text>
	<text planet="NONE">Emerging from your FTL jump, you find yourself in a mesmerizing binary star system. The view is breathtaking, yet amidst the celestial spectacle, a lone Rebel forward automated scout lurks nearby, a grim omen of an imminent clash that cannot be avoided.</text>
	<text>The Rebel Engineers have been busy in this sector to help pave the way for the Rebellions expansion. Thus, it's hardly astonishing to encounter one alongside its automated guardian, which promptly changes course to intercept you, while the engineering vessel hastily jumps away at the slightest hint of trouble.</text>
	
	<!-- colonies-->
	<text planet="PLANET_POPULATED_SMALL">You discover a nearby planet speckled with settlements, although none respond to your hails and you come to realize why; as an automated Rebel Ship comes speeding towards you..</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_POPULATED_SMALL">You discover a nearby planet speckled with settlements, one of them hails you. “Caution! The Rebels have claimed this system. It isn’t safe for-” the transmissions begins to break up. A Rebel Automated ship seems to be the source of the disruption and now it locks onto you and begins its assault.</text>

	<!-- normal -->
	<text>A Rebel autonomous scout is exploring this beacon. You attempt to hide behind a nearby moon, but the ship finds you and begins its assault.</text>
	<text>The AI of a nearby small Rebel scout immediately identifies you as a threat and engages.</text>

	<text planet="NONE">You are taken aback by the beauty of a nearby eclipse glowing radiantly from a nearby planetoid. You would have considered this a fortuitous moment to arrive just in time to witness such an event; if not for the familiar sounds of a Rebel ship hailing to state their intentions of eliminating you once and for all.</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_UNPOPULATED">This system is relatively undocumented and to your surprise, your ships sensors have detected various belts and moons rich and abundant of natural resources to any prospective frontiersmen that would be interested in settling in these parts… even more surprisingly your sensors have detected a Rebel ship that doesn’t wish to share with you this systems discovery.</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_UNPOPULATED">It’s uncommon to see manned Rebel ships this far out from any nearby fleet elements especially in neutral sectors such as these. You receive a transmission: “It’s you! Surrender to the talons of the Rebellion or face our wrath!”</text>
	<text planet="NONE" back="BG_NEBULA">A defiant Rebel hail disrupts the harmonious backdrop, declaring, 'Our war won't end until we've shattered your Federation dreams!' Weapons lock on and going hot.</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_UNPOPULATED">A Rebel ship contacts you near the emerging colonies, promising a 'safer world' for the frontier. Though they must have a different idea of what safe means as their weapons arm.</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_UNPOPULATED">A Rebel fighter's boastful hail is silenced as you prepare to engage in combat, cutting off their rhetoric against the sector's calm.</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_RINGS" back="BACKGROUND">In this sector of astronomic wonders, your arrival and a Rebel ship's coincide, leaving no choice but to clash amidst the untouched expanse.</text>

	<text planet="PLANET_MOONS">You have emerged to what appears to be a Rebel FOB being constructed on a nearby moon and they appear to have made us out! A Rebel ship breaks off from guarding the Riggers setting the base up and moves in to engage.</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_POPULATED_SMALL">You have arrived at this beacon and began going through your checklists before making for the next jump while the drive charges. But unbeknownst to you it seems a fledgling colony below does not fancy your arrival and has sent for a Rebel ship to expedite your departure.</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_UNPOPULATED_TERRA">It isn't a surprise that the Rebels have also shown interest in this sector, even more so attemtping to protect their claims here by attacking you on sight!</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_POPULATED_SMALL">Caught off guard by a Rebel ship near the burgeoning colonies, A confrontation is unavoidable with the mute ship refusing hails and entering an attack vector.</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_POPULATED_GRASSY">A Rebel ship has been patrolling this region collecting 'tariffs' on the nearby colonists. But as soon as you arrive it begins its assault.</text>
	
	<!-- normal encounters -->
	<text>You receive a transmission: "Sorry sir, this is nothing personal but we're under orders." The Rebel ship's weapons go hot.</text>
	<text>A Rebel ship hails. "We did not fight a war to let a single Federation ship shatter our dreams of a better galaxy!" He locks weapons.</text>
	<text>You're hailed by a Rebel ship: "When the rebellion is complete you'll see the safer world we provide. Well, you won't, but you get the point." They arm weapons.</text>
	<text>Your arrival coincides almost exactly with that of a Rebel ship. It's hard to know who is more surprised, but there is no option but to fight.</text>
