RVS stands for Ravpor Void Systems (R is subject to change, Ravpor being the original team / prefix name when it was just R4V3-0N and Porcu working on GB together).
This prefix is to be used currently for all player and enemy ships until further notice. The name was chosen as a sorta pseudo-lore adjacent ship and weapons manufacturer that represents the dev team in a lore friendly way.

Borrowing from MV's system:
RVS	= Regular Enemy Ships
RVSR	= Multiverse Renegade Enemy Ships
RVSP	= Player Ships
RVSPV	= Player Vanilla Ships
RVSPE	= Player Elite Ships

All ships will be slowly converted to this until further notice (I am still debating on if there should be a _ between RVS and any add-on letter suffix)

Let's see if we can make GB's ship prefixes consistent again!
